## Notes
- If you're experienced in development, building from source is strongly recommended over using the pre-built version. The pre-built release doesn't support custom features like muting on death, delayed channel joining, and other gameplay-specific mechanics.
- It is recommended to keep the code up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility. All updates are announced on our [Discord server](https://gta5voice.com/discord), including detailed changelogs and more.
- We recommend updating your server code to .NET 9.0 to avoid performance issues. The GTA5Voice Server-side code can be found here: https://github.com/GTA5Voice/ragemp-server-net9.0
